In this project, you’ll build a simple Unix shell. The shell is the heart of the command-line interface, and thus is central to the Unix/C programming environment. Mastering use of the shell is necessary to become proficient in this world; knowing how the shell itself is built is the focus of this project.

There are three specific objectives to this assignment:

To further familiarize yourself with the Linux programming environment.
To learn how processes are created, destroyed, and managed.
To gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.
Overview
In this assignment, you will implement a command line interpreter (CLI) or, as it is more commonly known, a shell. The shell should operate in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished.

The shells you implement will be similar to, but simpler than, the one you run every day in Unix. If you don’t know what shell you are running, it’s probably bash. One thing you should do on your own time is to learn more about your shell, by reading the man pages or other online materials.
